# Explanation
Categorically dividing the selectors into 2 basic categories: 
1. Basic Selectors
2. Advanced Selectors

Exploring the Basic Selectors
i. Element selector : merely selecting the element by its name
ii. Class selector : We can give a class to multiple elements, as well give multiple classes to a single element
iii. Id selector : Id needs to be unique
iv. Attribute selector : We select the element by comparing it with its attribute
v. Universal selector : This selects everything irrespective of anything, this is useful for giving padding and margin as different browsers have their default margin and padding values

Now, exploring the advanced selectors
i. Categorical selector {
1. Descendant (  ){space}
2. Child ( > ) 
3. General Sibling ( ~ )
4. Adjacent Sibling ( + )
}

ii. Pseudo Classes
iii. Structural Pseudo Elements
iv. String Matching { 
1. Starts with ( ^= )
2. Ends with ( $= )
3. Anything in between ( *= )
